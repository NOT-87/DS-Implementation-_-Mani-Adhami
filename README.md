Data Structures – Java Implementation

This project contains Java implementations of several fundamental data structures.
All structures are implemented as separate classes, and all their methods can be tested directly from the main class using a simple menu-based interface.

Implemented Data Structures
 
    1.Stack
      puch
      pop
      peek
      isEmpty
      isFull
      Print
   
    2.Circular Queue:
      Enqueue
      Dequeue
      Check empty / full
      Display elements
    
    3.Avl:
      hight
      max
      rightRotate
      leftRotate
      balanceFactor
      insert
      min
      preOrder
      print
    
    4.Max-Heap:
      insert
      delete
      Print
      
    5.Red-Black Tree:
      Insert
      Search
      Tree traversal
      Self-balancing after insertion
    
    6.Trie (Prefix Tree):
      Insert word
      Search word
      Check prefix

In Main, select the desired data structure from the menu.
All public methods of each class are accessible and can be tested interactively.
